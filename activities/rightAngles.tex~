\section{Of Course All Right Angles are Congruent\dots}	


\begin{prob}
Put a dot at the center of a blank sheet of paper and call it $O$.
Use a protractor to draw an angle of $50^\circ$ with vertex at the
point $O$ and sides extending all the way out to the edge of the
paper.  Cut the paper along one side of the angle and one side only.
Make a cone by moving the cut edge to the other side of the angle you
drew.  This cone (extended infinitely) is your universe.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Does Euclid's 1st Postulate hold in your universe? Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Does Euclid's 2nd Postulate hold in your universe? Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Does Euclid's 3rd Postulate hold in your universe? Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}\textbf{REWRITE THIS QUESTION}
You measure angles on your universe by laying the paper out flat and
measuring the angles on the paper. Draw a line that passes through $O$
along the cut edge. Now lay your paper flat and bisect the angle
formed by the other edge and your line. What does this say about
Euclid's 4th Postulate? Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}



\begin{prob}
Does Euclid's 5th Postulate hold in your universe? Explain your
reasoning. Big hint, how few sides can a $n$-gon have?
\end{prob}
