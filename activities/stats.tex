\section{The Applied Side---Stat!}

While Cantor was doing very abstract and pure mathematics in Germany,
statistics was making its first appearance as a mathematical subject
in England.  In this activity, we are going to investigate the \textit{mean}, \textit{median}, and \textit{mode} of a set of data. 


\begin{prob}
Explain what is meant by the mean, median, and mode of a set.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Give a set of data consisting of $6$ values (not all equal!) such that
the mean, median, and mode are all equal. Plot your data in some
reasonable way.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Give a set of data consisting of $6$ values such that the mean is
larger than both the median and mode which are equal. Plot your data in
some reasonable way.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
Give a set of data consisting of $6$ values such that the mode is
larger than both the mean and median. Plot your data in some
reasonable way.
\end{prob}

\paragraph{Simpson's Paradox}


In the 1970's a scandal arose at the University of California,
Berkley. There was a distinct gender bias against women in the number
of graduate students admitted among the 6 largest departments:
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline
 & Applicants & Admitted \\ \hline\hline
Men & 2590 & 46\% \\ \hline
Women & 1835 & 30\% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\]
Data from individual departments was collected for further investigation:
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c||c|c|} \hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Department} & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{Men} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Women}  \\\cline{2-5}
 & Applicants & Admitted & Applicants & Admitted \\\hline\hline
A & 825 & 62\% & 108 & 82\%\\ \hline
B & 560 & 63\% & 25 & 68\% \\ \hline
C & 325 & 37\% & 593 & 34\% \\ \hline
D & 417 & 33\% & 375 & 35\% \\ \hline
E & 191 & 28\% & 393 & 24\% \\ \hline
F & 272 & 6\% & 341 & 7\% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\]

\begin{prob}
Examine this data critically. What seems to be the case? Does this
jive with your intuition? What is actually happening? Can you explain
when this will happen?
\end{prob}


%Perhaps it is not surprising that a cousin of Charles
%Darwin was involve, inventing correlation and regression as
%statistical methods to study the evolution of the human species.

%As an example of what correlation means, suppose there were four sets
%of twin females that were split up at birth with one twin living her
%life in the U.S. and the other twin living her life in England.
%Suppose the average adult height of a female in the U.S.\ is 5'4'' with
%a standard deviation of 2'' and the average adult height of a female in
%England is 5'6'' with a standard deviation of 3''.
%\[
%\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|}\hline
%Twin set & U.S. & U.K. \\ \hline\hline
%1 & 5'6'' & 5'6'' \\\hline
%2 & 5'5'' & 5'4'' \\\hline
%3 & 5'6'' & 5'8'' \\\hline
%4 & 4'11'' & 5'6'' \\\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\]



%\begin{prob}
%Compute the correlation coefficient of this paired (twin) data using
%either formula for $r$ below.  

%Recall two methods of computing the \textit{sample correlation
%coefficient}, commonly denoted $r$:
%\[
%r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X%})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2}}
%\]
%An equivalent expression gives the correlation coefficient as the mean
%of the products of the standard scores.  Based on a sample of paired
%data $(X_i, Y_i)$, the sample correlation coefficient is:
%\[
%r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{X_i-\bar{X}}{\sigma_X} \right)\left(\frac{Y_i-\bar{Y}}{\sigma_Y} \right)
%\]
%\end{prob}

%\begin{prob}
%Figure out a single change in the data that makes the correlation
%coefficient bigger.
%\end{prob}



%Recall that Pearson's correlation coefficient between two variables is
%defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product
%of their standard deviations:
%\[
%\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\mathrm{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y} = \frac{E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\%mu_Y)]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}
%\]
%The above formula defines the \textit{population correlation
%coefficient}, commonly represented by the Greek letter $\rho$
%(rho). Substituting estimates of the covariances and variances based
%on a sample gives the
%\textit{sample correlation coefficient}, commonly denoted $r$:
