\section{Polyhedral Planets}	


In this activity, we will suppose in turn that you live on a planet
that is shaped like each of the regular convex polyhedra---not unlike
\textit{Le Petit Prince} who lives on an asteroid.

\begin{prob}
Considering each of the five regular convex polyhedra in turn, what
fraction of the planet's surface could you see if you stood:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the middle of a face? 
\item In the middle of an edge?
\item On a vertex?
\end{enumerate}
In each case, explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}



\begin{prob}
Now suppose that you wish to go on a walk, surveying your polyhedral
planet. For each platonic solid, give the shortest path you can (draw
it on a net) that would allow you to observe the entire planet. In
each case, explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}
