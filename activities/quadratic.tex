\section{Geometry and Quadratic Equations}	



In ancient and Medieval times the discussion of quadratic equations
was often broken into three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x^2 + bx = c$
\item $x^2 = bx + c$
\item $x^2 + c = bx$
\end{enumerate}
where $b$ and $c$ are positive numbers. 


\begin{prob}
Create real-world word problems involving length and area for each
case above.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Solve each of the three cases above by actually ``completing the
square'' using a \textbf{real} square.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Is this a complete list of cases? If not, what is missing and why is
it (are they) missing? Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}
