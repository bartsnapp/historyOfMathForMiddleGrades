\section{Attack of Ferro-Tartaglia}

You may recall that the Ferro-Tartaglia method gives 
\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{-1+\sqrt{-31}}{2}} + \frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}(-1+\sqrt{-31})}}
\]
as a solution to: $y = x^3-6x+1$. Moreover, as this plot of $y = x^3-6x+1$ shows
\[

\]
this must be a real solution\dots But how? There is a square-root of a
negative number in the expression above! Ok, uncharacteristically for
me, I'll show you how this is done. Please fasten your seatbelts and
place your trays in the upright postion.

Start by looking at:
\[
\frac{-1+\sqrt{-31}}{2}
\]
