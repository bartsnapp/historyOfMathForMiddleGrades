\fbox{simpson's paradox}


While Cantor was doing very abstract and pure mathematics in Germany,
statistics was making its first appearance as a mathematical subject
in England.  Perhaps it is not surprising that a cousin of Charles
Darwin was involve, inventing correlation and regression as
statistical methods to study the evolution of the human species.

As an example of what correlation means, suppose there were four sets
of twin females that were split up at birth with one twin living her
life in the U.S. and the other twin living her life in England.
Suppose the average adult height of a female in the U.S.\ is 5'4'' with
a standard deviation of 2'' and the average adult height of a female in
England is 5'6'' with a standard deviation of 3''.
\[
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|}\hline
Twin set & U.S. & U.K. \\ \hline\hline
1 & 5'6'' & 5'6'' \\\hline
2 & 5'5'' & 5'4'' \\\hline
3 & 5'6'' & 5'8'' \\\hline
4 & 4'11'' & 5'6'' \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\]



\begin{prob}
Compute the correlation coefficient of this paired (twin) data using
either formula for $r$ below.  

Recall two methods of computing the \textit{sample correlation
coefficient}, commonly denoted $r$:
\[
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2}}
\]
An equivalent expression gives the correlation coefficient as the mean
of the products of the standard scores.  Based on a sample of paired
data $(X_i, Y_i)$, the sample correlation coefficient is:
\[
r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{X_i-\bar{X}}{\sigma_X} \right)\left(\frac{Y_i-\bar{Y}}{\sigma_Y} \right)
\]
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Figure out a single change in the data that makes the correlation
coefficient bigger.
\end{prob}



%Recall that Pearson's correlation coefficient between two variables is
%defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product
%of their standard deviations:
%\[
%\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\mathrm{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y} = \frac{E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\%mu_Y)]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}
%\]
%The above formula defines the \textit{population correlation
%coefficient}, commonly represented by the Greek letter $\rho$
%(rho). Substituting estimates of the covariances and variances based
%on a sample gives the
%\textit{sample correlation coefficient}, commonly denoted $r$:
