\section{Voting Woes}	


In this activity, we are going to investigate the condrums that arise
when voting. With this in mind, I think it might be fitting to include
one of my favorite quotes:

\begin{quote}
If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.  

\hfill---John von Neumann
\end{quote}

With that said, let's go! There are lots of different voting
systems---here we describe three of them:

\begin{prob}

\end{prob}



\begin{prob}

\end{prob}
