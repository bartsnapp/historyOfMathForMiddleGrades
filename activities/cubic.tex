Somewhere deep in your brain is a sleeping technique\dots AWAKE!
We want to solve:
\[
x^3 + 9x -26 =0
\]
We're going to have to use the Ferro-Tartaglia method, but all I can tell you are these three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Replace $x$ with $u+v$. 
\item Set $uv$ so that all of the terms are eliminated except for $u^3$,
$v^3$, and constant terms.  
\item Clear denominators and use the quadratic formula.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{prob}
Use the Ferro-Tartaglia method to solve $x^3 + 9x -26 =0$.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob}
How many solutions should our equation above have? Where/what are they?
Hint: Make use of an old forgotten foe\dots
